# kasunbot
--------

kasunbot is a slackbot created as a learning exercise to familiarise myself with node, and also as a parting memory from my time at General Assembly. kasunbot responds to certain words with one-liners I'd collected during our time as his students

## Environments

kasunbot was developed in
- OS X El Capitan v 10.11.6
- node 6.9.1
- botkit 0.4.9
- lodash 4.17.4


## Installation

To use this bot, download this repo and run `npm install`. You will need to [create a bot user](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) in the slack channel you wish to add him to, then include your slack token as an environment variable and run `npm start`

Alternatively, the bot is currently hosted on heroku. You can [generate an invite](https://quiet-dawn-90537.herokuapp.com/) to the slack channel he lives in if you'd like to chat to him.

## Discussion

kasunbot is my first slack project and also my first project in Node. The botkit library and the simplicity of the bot responses meant that this wasn't a technically difficult project.

When I have time, there's a few more responses I'd like to add, as well as a slash command suggesting some of the words that the bot responds to.
